# CELEBRATION: +300 Version 2.0 - custom-made bagde
CODE WRITTEN BY: Luis Febro
GOAL: Celebrate new badge making mention of main warriors who fought with me in the hall of fame and show reports on it.
DATE OF LAUNCH: 07/17/19
LAST MAIN UPDATES:
Main updates from +300 version 2:
1. More new warriors from second day of battle from 19th July 2019.
2. New challenges titles (trophies and medals):
*battle medals (up until 2 challenges);
*maxSilver (1x multi storm [+3 challenges]);
*maxSilverPlus (2x multi storm [+3 challenges each]);
*maxGold (1x full storm [+12 challenges]);
*maxGoldPlus (1x multi storm and 1x full storm);
*maxPlatinum (2x full storm);
There are 5 new brand trophy design creations.
P.S no, there is no "max steel" u.u)
3. Better RWD (Responsive Web Design) for all devices. Fixed tembling effect due to viewport on some types of mobile device especially Iphone and devices less than 230px of width.
4. Added Polyfillers for JS code to get cross-browser/mobile compatibility. Now old smartphones/browsers pals can run my code too. (=
5. Friendly general transitions and animations, and easterEggs around the code.
6. Fixed text aligning from the pics, clean design for general elements.
P.S The names are now out of reach from the mouth of the warriors. I do not know if someone noticed this, but I did and improved it.
7. Accordions for reports for a more elegant visualization of informations in separated blocks.
8. Different Modals both boxes and images for better visualization of key images and off-screen messages and multimedia.
9. warrior's card on the hall of fame gallery including name, title and description, days of JS challenges battles and one dynamic ranking of SL stay - oldest to newest registered members according to ID.
10. General fixes in the code includes improving structure of data and media query,  better description of identifiers, etc.
Final Notes: Although my temptation of using really hassle-free libraries and frameworks, I was resolute to write a pure HTML/CSS/Vanilla JS code for this time. But just for a sake of the challenge that I have in mind.
I will start exploring through them deeply very soon and make my life even easier. (=
11. Added HTML5Shiv to support new HTML semantic elements and their styles.


NEXT FIXES|UPDATE:
1. fixed top red board is appearing too early. it supposes to appear only on the hall of fame. (pending)
2. Flickering Effect while scrolling [line 614 JS] (solved);
3. Fixed position for close button on modals (pending)
4. alert button at the bottom displayed at the wrong time/ or runs only once. it supposes to display when user does not get infos in the cards. (pending)
5. [line 109 CSS] Sticky position for close button on modal boxes (solved)
6. [line 642 JS] - run function only if user click on the image to avoid all infos from the card to be replaced "-" when he/she click (pending)
7. [line 64 HTML] modal image cards - set to scroll to the top every time the user switch between the warrior cards (pending);
